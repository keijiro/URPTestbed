About the Demo scene
--------------------

The `Demo` scene uses a statue model (`Hosmer.blend`), but this repository
doesn't contain the model file due to the file size limitation of GitHub.

You can download the file from [the Releases page]. Put the downloaded file in
the `Assets/Demo/Statue` directory. Note that you have to put the file before
opening the project because Unity will remove `.meta` file when the file body
is missing.

[the Releases page]:
  https://github.com/keijiro/URPTestbed/releases/tag/1.0.0

You also have to install [Blender] to import `.blend` files.
